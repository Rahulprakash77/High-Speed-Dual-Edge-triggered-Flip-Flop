## D-Latch Circuit:

In the modern era, there is a significant demand for circuits with fast switching activity and low area implementation, particularly for memory components. Existing designs often suffer from issues like high delay, dynamic power consumption, and excessive area usage. Fully static flip-flops, though reliable, typically require large layout areas. Clock-gated techniques aim to reduce power but introduce significant energy consumption due to leakage and parasitic capacitances. Advanced designs incorporating 14 transistors and 4 inverters show potential but still face challenges like high power consumption and large area due to internal capacitance.

Innovative methods, such as glitch-resistant flip-flops, help minimize glitches using a unique logic structure, but these circuits also suffer from complexity and high impedance states. Performance enhancement techniques like dual-phase fully static operations in TSPC-DETFF improve functionality but come with high area and delay costs. Conditional pass logic-based flip-flops address some issues by employing static and dynamic operations, but their area requirements remain high.

To overcome these challenges, a dual-edge-triggered flip-flop design is proposed, using pass transistor logic (PTL) and CMOS logic with dynamic signal driving. This approach significantly reduces area, improves switching activity, and lowers power consumption. The use of PTL minimizes delays, while CMOS logic enhances signal integrity, making this design efficient and suitable for high-speed applications.
